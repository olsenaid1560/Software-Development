## About me
> Hello, I'm Aiden Olsen. I'm 19 as of the time of writing this and I'm interested in developing websites and making indie video games. Interact with me, I love to talk to people! ❤️

## Goals
I'm taking the Software Development program to be able to develop websites as a job in the future, and to become an indie game dev as a hobby.
But who knows, maybe that will go somewhere too and I'll make the next big indie game lol.
